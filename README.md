Telecom Customer Churn Prediction
https://via.placeholder.com/800x400?text=Customer+Churn+Analysis
Visualization of customer churn patterns (example image)

📌 Overview
This project develops a machine learning solution to predict customer churn in the telecom industry. By analyzing historical customer data, we identify key indicators of churn and build predictive models to help telecom companies proactively retain customers and reduce acquisition costs.

Key Highlights:

Comprehensive EDA to understand churn drivers

Multiple ML models evaluated (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)

Feature importance analysis to identify critical churn factors

Cost-benefit analysis of intervention strategies

📊 Problem Statement
Customer acquisition costs 5x more than retention. This project addresses:

High customer turnover in telecom industry

Lack of proactive retention strategies

Revenue loss from unexpected churn

Need for data-driven retention programs
